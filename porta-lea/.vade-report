## Vercel Web Analytics Implementation for Astro

Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for this Astro project.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Analytics Component Integration
**File: `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`**
- Imported the Analytics component from `@vercel/analytics/astro` in the frontmatter
- Added the `<Analytics />` component in the `<head>` section
- Route support is automatically included by the component

#### 2. Adapter Configuration Update
**File: `astro.config.mjs`**
- Disabled the legacy `webAnalytics.enabled` configuration in the Vercel adapter
- This prevents conflicts since we're using the modern `@vercel/analytics@1.5.0` component approach

#### 3. TypeScript Configuration
**File: `tsconfig.json`**
- Added `"skipLibCheck": true` to improve build performance and avoid unnecessary library type checks

**File: `src/@types/vercel-analytics.d.ts`** (new file)
- Created custom type declarations for `@vercel/analytics/astro` module
- This resolves TypeScript checking issues caused by the package's .astro file exports
- The Vercel Analytics package itself uses `@ts-expect-error` for these exports, indicating this is a known limitation

#### 4. Build Artifact Exclusion
**File: `.gitignore`**
- Added `.vercel/` directory to gitignore to exclude build artifacts from version control

#### 5. Dependencies
**File: `package-lock.json`**
- Updated lock file after running `npm install`
- Verified that `@vercel/analytics@1.5.0` is properly installed (was already present in package.json)

### Implementation Notes

- The project already had `@vercel/analytics@1.5.0` installed in its dependencies
- Used npm as the package manager (detected via package-lock.json)
- The build completes successfully with no errors
- All tests pass, and the type checking is working correctly
- The Analytics component will automatically track page views with route information

### Verification

✅ Build successful: `npm run build` completes without errors
✅ Type checking passes: `astro check` completes with 0 errors
✅ Dependencies installed and lock file updated
✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

The Vercel Web Analytics is now properly configured and will automatically track analytics when deployed to Vercel.
